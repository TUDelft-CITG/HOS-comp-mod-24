# Information about this Unit
{:.no_toc}

This unit is part of three B modules offered in Q4 of the Hydraulic and Offshore Structures (HOS) track in the Civil Engineering MSc program at TU Delft:
- <a href="https://studiegids.tudelft.nl/a101_displayCourse.do?course_id=63755" target="_blank">CIEM4210 Marine Renewables</a>
- <a href="https://studiegids.tudelft.nl/a101_displayCourse.do?course_id=63756" target="_blank">CIEM4220 Dams, Dikes and Breakwaters</a>
- <a href="https://studiegids.tudelft.nl/a101_displayCourse.do?course_id=63757" target="_blank">CIEM4230 Floating and Submerged Structures</a>

 Each HOS B Module has three units: B-1 Probabilistic Design (this unit), B-2, Computational Modeling and B-3 Design of the structures related to the modules mentioned above.
 
 The units Probabilistic Design and Computational Modeling are shared by all three B modules; therefore, we created a single separate website rather than maintain 3 separate Brightspace pages!

Although each of these B modules look at a wide range of structures, there are a couple important things in common: hydraulic loads govern the design of each system and structure; and failures can lead to significant consequences related to economic damages and loss of life. There is a high level of uncertainty in the hydraulic loads as well as the geotechnical conditions where these systems are operating. This makes probability, risk analysis and reliability-based design key tools for the design, assessment and maintenance of these structures. The purpose of the unit CIEM42X0 Probabilistic Design is to support you in this effort for your system and structure of interest. As such, the unit is built on several key elements:
- Three primary technical topics: 1) extreme value analysis, 2) component reliability and 3) system reliability (week 7)
- A series of (online) reading assignments and exercises (homework)
- A weekly lecture to cover theoretical aspects of each topic
- A weekly workshop that will apply concepts to design cases

These key elements of the unit are described in the sections below.

## Friday In-Class Sessions

Our in-class sessions will typically be Friday mornings (9:45-12:45) in Bouwcampus Hall 1. Most of the time we will try to finish by 12:00. In total there will be 5 sessions: weeks 3, 5, 6, 7, 8. For each session, you will be asked to complete some reading, practice assignments and watch a few short explanatory videos. Some of the assignments will require writing computer code. Although the assignments are not required to be submitted, the equations and code are incorporated directly in the in-class sessions.

The format of the in-class sessions will be workshop-style, where you will work in small groups to solve the assignments, and then share results and questions with classmates and instructors towards the end of the class period. Instructors will give an introduction to the workshop and preview of the upcoming week activities at the beginning and end of each session.

## Assignments

This unit has two types of assignments: homework and workshops, both of which will be shared via the HOS book (introduced below). For all assignments in this unit, you are encouraged to work collaboratively; however, we also encourage you to work out analytic exercises yourself and write your own code, as this is a valuable part of the learning process.
### Homework

Homework assignments are a mix of analytic and coding exercises to prepare you for the Friday workshops, as well as your B module design assignments and exams. In most cases they do not need to be turned in, and solutions will be shared after the due dates indicated in the calendar for you to check your work. We are working on setting up an autograder to help you check whether or not your code is working as expeced, which would be optional. This involves pushing your code to a GitLab repository we create for you, similar to what we did in MUDE; more information will be provided about this in week 3.

The recommended dates for you to start and finish the homework assignments are indicated in the calendar with these buttons: <a href="https://tudelft-citg.github.io/HOS-prob-design/unlisted/assignment.html" target="_blank">Start HW 1</a>{: .label .label-red } and <a href="https://tudelft-citg.github.io/HOS-prob-design/unlisted/assignment.html" target="_blank">HW 1 Due</a>{: .label .label-red }. Note that the buttons contain links that take you to the assignments and solutions in the HOS book (once they are available).

### Workshops

These are meant to be completed in class on Fridays, and build directly on the homework assignments; in some cases you will be asked to use the code from your homework assignment in the workshop. After completing a few calculations, the workshops will emphasize interpreting the results and making decisions to help you in the design of your structure and systems, especially as required for your design projects and exams.

You are not expected to turn in the workshop assignments, and solutions will be provided in the HOS book after the session. Workshops are shown in the calendar with a purple button like this: <a href="https://tudelft-citg.github.io/HOS-prob-design/unlisted/assignment.html" target="_blank">Workshop</a>{: .label .label-purple }

### Design Assignments and Projects

Depending on your B module, you will work on a design-oriented project. Each of them have different scope and requirements, but all of them will have a section that requires you to apply concepts from this unit. Between the design assignments and exams, the probabilistic design component will represent 20% of the total grade you recieve for your B module. Although the assignments and workshops from this unit are not included directly in the grade for the B module, if you are able to complete them you will have no problem getting a good evaluation for the 20% probabilistic design portion of the module.

## Resources

There are two primary resources for this unit, both of which can be accessed online.

### HOS Book

The <a href="https://tudelft-citg.github.io/HOS-prob-design/intro.html" target="_blank">HOS book</a> is an online textbook similar to that used in MUDE for weeks 2.7-2.8. In addition to technical content, it will also be used to share the homework and workshop assignments. It has three main parts:
- **Probabilistic Design**: chapters in this part contain an introduction to the course and various topics related to component and structural reliability that are not covered in the ADK book. Reading from this chapter is listed in the calendar with a link, for example, <a href="https://tudelft-citg.github.io/HOS-prob-design/PD/01_00_intro.html" target="_blank">HOS-PD-1</a> is Chapter 1 of the Probabilistic Design part.
- **Extreme Value Analysis**: chapters in this part provide underlying theory to help understand the EVA procedure that is key for assessing hydraulic loads in HOS projects. Reading from this chapter is listed in the calendar with a link, for example, <a href="https://tudelft-citg.github.io/HOS-prob-design/EVA/01_00_Extreme.html" target="_blank">HOS-EVA-1</a> is Chapter 1 of the Extreme Value Analysis part. The EVA material from MUDE is also included in this part of the HOS book for you to be able to refer to it easily (<a href="https://tudelft-citg.github.io/HOS-prob-design/EVA/MUDE/01_00_MUDE.html" target="_blank">HOS-EVA-5</a>).
- **Homework** and **Workshop** assignments and solutions will be added to the HOS book throughout Q4, as described above.

This book will be actively updated throughout the quarter; primarily with assignments and solutions, but also new technical content may be added, depending on questions and needs from students. The home page of the HOS book will list the updates made throughout the quarter. D epending on the importance or urgency, some (but not all) of these updates may also be communicated via announcements on this website or the Brightspace page for your B module.

### Other Resources

All topics we discuss build on what was covered in . Some of the chapters in the MUDE book are included in the <a href="https://teachbooks.tudelft.nl/risk-reliability/intro.html" target="_blank">Risk and Reliability book</a>.

This unit replaced a 1st-year MSc course CIE4130 Probabilistic Design in the old curriculum. The lecture notes (14MB) can be downloaded <a href="https://surfdrive.surf.nl/files/index.php/s/acbbK9bZ2fAjOx1/download" attributes-list download>here</a>.  In particular, the chapters on structural reliability and system reliability may be interesting.

For those who want more background in the topics of this unit, two excellent textbooks are recommended for the component and system reliability part of the course. The first has a more thorough treatment of theory (including probability theory and some multivariate probability distributions), whereas the second is a more simple and practical treatment.
